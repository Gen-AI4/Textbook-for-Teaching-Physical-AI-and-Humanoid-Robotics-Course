# Module 3: Locomotion and Balance

## Overview

Locomotion and balance are fundamental challenges in humanoid robotics. Unlike wheeled or tracked robots, humanoid robots must manage complex multi-link systems with many degrees of freedom while maintaining stability on two legs. This module covers the principles of bipedal locomotion, balance control, and the integration of these capabilities with AI systems.

Humanoid robots face unique challenges in locomotion due to their high center of gravity, limited support base, and the need to dynamically balance during movement. This module explores both the mechanical and control aspects of achieving stable and efficient locomotion.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the principles of bipedal locomotion
- Implement basic balance control algorithms
- Design walking patterns for humanoid robots
- Integrate locomotion with perception and planning systems

## Module Structure

This module is organized as follows:

1. [Principles of Bipedal Locomotion](./chapter-1.md) - Fundamentals of walking and balance
2. [Balance Control Systems](./chapter-2.md) - Techniques for maintaining stability
3. [Walking Pattern Generation](./chapter-3.md) - Creating stable walking gaits
4. [Adaptive Locomotion](./chapter-4.md) - Adjusting locomotion to terrain and tasks

## Prerequisites

Before studying this module, ensure you have:

- Understanding of humanoid robot kinematics from previous modules
- Knowledge of control systems and dynamics
- Basic understanding of physics of walking and balance

## Connection to Humanoid Robotics

Effective locomotion and balance are what distinguish humanoid robots from other robot types. This module covers:

- How to maintain balance during single and double support phases
- Techniques for recovering from disturbances
- Methods for walking on uneven terrain
- Integration of locomotion with other robot behaviors

Let's begin with understanding the principles of bipedal locomotion.
