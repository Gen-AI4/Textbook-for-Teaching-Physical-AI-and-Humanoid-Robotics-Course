## About This Textbook

Welcome to the Textbook for Teaching Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This comprehensive resource is designed to provide educators and students with the knowledge and tools necessary to understand and implement physical artificial intelligence in humanoid robotic systems.

### Mission Statement

Our mission is to advance the field of humanoid robotics through accessible, comprehensive, and practical educational materials that bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world implementation.

### Textbook Philosophy

This textbook follows several key principles:

1. **Physical AI and Robotics Education First**: All content is grounded in real-world applications of physical AI and humanoid robotics, emphasizing practical implementation over purely theoretical concepts.

2. **Accessibility and Pedagogical Effectiveness**: Content is designed to accommodate diverse learning styles and abilities, with clear explanations, visual aids, and structured learning pathways.

3. **Reproducible Research and Experimentation**: All examples and projects are designed to be reproducible, with clear instructions and well-documented code examples.

4. **Interdisciplinary Integration**: Content recognizes that humanoid robotics draws from multiple fields including computer science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and cognitive science.

5. **Safety and Ethical Considerations**: Safety and ethics are integrated throughout the curriculum, not treated as afterthoughts.

6. **Simulation-Based Learning**: A simulation-first approach that allows for safe, reproducible experimentation before hardware implementation.

### Target Audience

This textbook is designed for:

- Undergraduate and graduate students studying robotics
- Educators teaching robotics and AI courses
- Researchers entering the field of humanoid robotics
- Engineers seeking to implement physical AI systems
- Technology enthusiasts with programming background

### Content Structure

The textbook is organized into interconnected modules that build upon each other:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Foundation in ROS 2 architecture, Python integration, URDF, and simulation
- **Module 2**: Physical AI Concepts - AI adapted for physical systems
- **Module 3**: Locomotion and Balance - Bipedal locomotion and balance control
- **Module 4**: Human-Robot Interaction - Principles of effective human-robot interaction

### Technology Approach

This textbook takes an open-source first approach, utilizing:

- ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) as the primary framework
- Docusaurus for documentation and textbook publishing
- Gazebo for simulation
- Standard programming languages like Python and C++
