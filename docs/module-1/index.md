# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

In this module, we'll explore ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the nervous system for many robotic applications, especially humanoid robots. ROS 2 provides the communication framework, tools, and libraries that enable complex robotic behaviors.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Identify and explain the roles of nodes, topics, and services
- Create simple ROS 2 nodes using Python
- Define robot models using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Integrate ROS 2 with simulation environments

## Module Structure

This module is organized as follows:

1. [ROS 2 Fundamentals](./chapter-1.md) - Core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
2. [Python Integration with ROS 2](./chapter-2.md) - Using rclpy client library
3. [Robot Description with URDF](./chapter-3.md) - Creating robot models
4. [ROS 2 in Simulation](./chapter-4.md) - Connecting to simulation environments

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this module, ensure you have:

- Basic understanding of programming in Python
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Access to a system with ROS 2 installed (or Docker container with ROS 2)

Let's begin with the fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture.
