# Module 2: Physical AI Concepts

## Overview

This module covers the fundamental concepts of Physical AI - a field that bridges traditional artificial intelligence with physical systems. Unlike conventional AI that operates primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI involves AI systems that interact directly with the physical world through sensors and actuators.

Physical AI is particularly relevant to humanoid robotics, where AI algorithms must process real-world sensor data and generate commands that affect physical systems in real-time. This module explores how AI techniques are adapted for the constraints and opportunities of physical systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Distinguish Physical AI from traditional AI approaches
- Understand the challenges of implementing AI on physical systems
- Identify key techniques for Physical AI applications
- Apply Physical AI principles to humanoid robotics problems

## Module Structure

This module is organized as follows:

1. [Introduction to Physical AI](./chapter-1.md) - Understanding the Physical AI paradigm
2. [Sensing and Perception in Physical AI](./chapter-2.md) - Processing real-world sensor data
3. [Actuation and Control in Physical AI](./chapter-3.md) - Generating physical actions from AI decisions
4. [Learning in Physical Systems](./chapter-4.md) - Machine learning approaches for physical systems

## Prerequisites

Before studying this module, ensure you have:

- Understanding of basic AI and machine learning concepts
- Basic knowledge of physics (especially mechanics)
- Familiarity with the ROS 2 concepts from Module 1

## Connection to Humanoid Robotics

Physical AI concepts are fundamental to humanoid robotics, where the AI must:
- Process sensor data from multiple modalities (vision, touch, proprioception)
- Coordinate complex multi-joint movements
- Adapt to real-world uncertainties and disturbances
- Make decisions under time constraints for real-time control

Let's begin with the fundamentals of Physical AI.
